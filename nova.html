          During the following months I decided that I wanted to learn how to
          make 3D models. So I began to teach myself

          Like most people, I began by learning how to create a doughnut and a
          coffee cup, but before long I wanted to design more adventurous
          models...

          I only used "hard-body" modelling to create a super nintendo which

        Whilst still working on "hard-body" modelling I began to experiment with

        When creating this robot model I wanted to attempt to create soft fabric
        for the trousers and wrist strap.

      <p class="nova-text-bot nova-bot-anim">
        It was during this time that I began to look into the posibility of 3D
        printing my models and the pitfalls that would occur if the model was
        not designed correctly.

          I began learning how to correctly create a model in Blender using best
          practice, to ensure not only a solid model, but also one that can be
          printed without errors or failed prints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using what I learnt from the previous model I leaned more into the
          "soft-body" design when creating my models which lent itself to more
          realistic designs and real-world objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently host all my publicly avaiable 3d models on cults3d
          website, with some of my models gaining thousands of downloads and
          hundreds of likes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope in the future to incorporate my 3D designs more into my
          websites on both a personal and professional level.
